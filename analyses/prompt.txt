Do you know Appraisal Theory developed my Martin and White (2005)? Appraisal Theory consists of Attitude, Engagement and Graduation. Attitude consists of Affect, Judgement and Appreciation. Affect consists of these values: inclination (sub-value desire), disinclination (sub-value fear), happiness (sub-values cheer and affection), unhappiness (sub-values misery and antipathy), security (sub-values confidence and trust), insecurity (sub-values disquiet and apprehension), satisfaction (sub-values interest and pleasure), dissatisfaction (sub-values ennui and displeasure). Judgement consists of these values: social esteem (sub-values normality, capacity and tenacity) and social sanction (sub-values veracity and propriety). Appreciation consists of these values: reaction (sub-values impact, quality), composition (sub-values balance and complexity) and valuation. Can you annotate all the evaluative linguistic instances of Affect, Judgement and Appreciation in this text and create a list for me? Assign one of the sub-values of Affect, Judgement and Appreciation that are in brackets to evaluative linguistic instance. Please assign only one value to each evaluative linguistic instance. Focus on verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. Do not annotate the whole sentence. Please annotate only the linguistic instances that correspond to Affect, Judgement and Appreciation and its sub-values. This is the text:
