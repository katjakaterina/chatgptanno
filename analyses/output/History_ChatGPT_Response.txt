- happiness (cheer and affection): "cheering" [cheer], "Thank you" [affection], "beautiful" [cheer], "fun" [cheer], "fired up" [affection], "loving" [affection].
- unhappiness (misery and antipathy): "horrible" [misery].
- satisfaction (interest and pleasure): "hip-hop" [pleasure], "interest" [interest], "hipness" [interest], “amazing” [pleasure].

- reaction (impact, quality): "profound" [impact], "super-smart" [quality], "greatest" [impact], "soothing" [quality].
- composition (balance and complexity): "paradox" [complexity], "esoteric" [complexity].
