Please note that some words could align with more than one sub-value as affect, judgment, and appreciation can be subjective and context-dependent. The annotations provided align with the most apparent sub-values in the given context. The list might not be exhaustive as some phrases could be interpreted in various ways according to the Appraisal Theory.
