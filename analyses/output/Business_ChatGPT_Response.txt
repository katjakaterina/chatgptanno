- need [desire]
- wish [desire]
- stand [confidence]

Please note that the assignment of sub-values may vary with interpretation since many words can reflect multiple facets of Affect, Judgment, or Appreciation. The context is also crucial; for example, the word "steals" could be seen as negatively charged (disinclination - desire) but also touches on veracity within social sanction, questioning if it’s actually accurate to describe the act as stealing within the metaphorical sense used.
